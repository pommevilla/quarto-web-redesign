title: "Hello Quarto"
---

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. Quarto documents are authored using markdown, an easy-to-write plain text format.

In addition to the core capabilities of Pandoc, quarto includes:

1.  Support for embedding output from Python, R, and Julia via integration with Jupyter and Knitr .
2.  A variety of extensions to Pandoc markdown useful for technical writing including callouts (admonitions), cross-references, sub-figures, layout panels, hover-able citations and footnotes, and more.
3.  A project system for rendering groups of documents at once, sharing options across documents, and producing aggregate output like books and websites.
4.  HTML output based on Bootstrap (including support for Bootswatch themes).
5.  Automatic installation of required LaTeX packages when rendering PDF output.

The overall design of quarto is influenced heavily by R Markdown, however unlike R Markdown the architecture is language agnostic. In it's current iteration, quarto can render plain Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, and Knitr (Rmd) documents.
